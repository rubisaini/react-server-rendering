  "readme": "# React Router Config\n\nStatic route configuration helpers for React Router.\n\nThis is alpha software, it needs:\n\n1. Realistic server rendering example with data preloading\n2. Pending navigation example\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n    $ npm install --save react-router-config\n\nThen with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:\n\n```js\n// using an ES6 transpiler, like babel\nimport { matchRoutes, renderRoutes } from 'react-router-config'\n\n// not using an ES6 transpiler\nvar matchRoutes = require('react-router-config').matchRoutes\n```\n\nThe UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-router-config/umd/react-router-config.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nYou can find the library on `window.ReactRouterConfig`\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the introduction of React Router v4, there is no longer a centralized route configuration. There are some use-cases where it is valuable to know about all the app's potential routes such as:\n\n- Loading data on the server or in the lifecycle before rendering the next screen\n- Linking to routes by name\n- Static analysis\n\nThis project seeks to define a shared format for others to build patterns on top of.\n\n## Route Configuration Shape\n\nRoutes are objects with the same properties as a `<Route>` with a couple differences:\n\n- the only render prop it accepts is `component` (no `render` or `children`)\n- introduces the `routes` key for sub routes\n- Consumers are free to add any additional props they'd like to a route, you can access `props.route` inside the `component`, this object is a reference to the object used to render and match.\n\n```js\nconst routes = [\n  { component: Root,\n    routes: [\n      { path: '/',\n        exact: true,\n        component: Home\n      },\n      { path: '/child/:id',\n        component: Child,\n        routes: [\n          { path: '/child/:id/grand-child',\n            component: GrandChild\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n**Note**: Just like `<Route>`, relative paths are not (yet) supported. When it is supported there, it will be supported here.\n\n## API\n\n### `matchRoutes(routes, pathname)`\n\nReturns an array of matched routes.\n\n```js\nimport { matchRoutes } from 'react-router-config'\nconst branch = matchRoutes(routes, '/child/23')\n// using the routes shown earlier, this returns\n// [\n//   routes[0],\n//   routes[0].routes[1]\n// ]\n```\n\nEach item in the array contains two properties: `route` and `match`.\n\n- `route`: A reference to the route used to match\n- `match`: The match object that also gets passed to `<Route>` render methods.\n\n```js\nbranch[0].match.url\nbranch[0].match.isExact\n// etc.\n```\n\nYou can use this branch of routes to figure out what is going to be rendered before it actually is rendered. You could do something like this on the server before rendering, or in a lifecycle hook of a component that wraps your entire app\n\n```js\nconst loadBranchData = (location) => {\n  const branch = matchRoutes(routes, location.pathname)\n\n  const promises = branch.map(({ route, match }) => {\n    return route.loadData\n      ? route.loadData(match)\n      : Promise.resolve(null)\n  })\n\n  return Promise.all(promises)\n}\n\n// useful on the server for preloading data\nloadBranchData(req.url).then(data => {\n  putTheDataSomewhereTheClientCanFindIt(data)\n})\n\n// also useful on the client for \"pending navigation\" where you\n// load up all the data before rendering the next page when\n// the url changes\n\n// THIS IS JUST SOME THEORETICAL PSEUDO CODE :)\nclass PendingNavDataLoader extends Component {\n  state = {\n    previousLocation: null\n  }\n\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    const navigated = nextProps.location !== this.props.location\n    const { routes } = this.props\n\n    if (navigated) {\n      // save the location so we can render the old screen\n      this.setState({\n        previousLocation: this.props.location\n      })\n\n      // load data while the old screen remains\n      loadNextData(routes, nextProps.location).then((data) => {\n        putTheDataSomewhereRoutesCanFindIt(data)\n        // clear previousLocation so the next screen renders\n        this.setState({\n          previousLocation: null\n        })\n      })\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { children, location } = this.props\n    const { previousLocation } = this.state\n    \n    // use a controlled <Route> to trick all descendants into \n    // rendering the old location\n    return (\n      <Route \n        location={previousLocation || location} \n        render={() => children}\n      />\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n// wrap in withRouter\nexport default withRouter(PendingNavDataLoader)\n\n/////////////\n// somewhere at the top of your app\nimport routes from './routes'\n\n<BrowserRouter>\n  <PendingNavDataLoader routes={routes}>\n    {renderRoutes(routes)}\n  </PendingNavDataLoader>\n</BrowserRouter>\n```\n\nAgain, that's all pseudo-code. There are a lot of ways to do server rendering with data and pending navigation and we haven't settled on one. The point here is that `matchRoutes` gives you a chance to match statically outside of the render lifecycle. We'd like to make a demo app of this approach eventually.\n\n### `renderRoutes(routes)`\n\nIn order to ensure that matching outside of render with `matchRoutes` and inside of render result in the same branch, you must use `renderRoutes` instead of `<Route>` inside your components. You can render a `<Route>` still, but know that it will not be accounted for in `matchRoutes` outside of render.\n\n```js\nimport { renderRoutes } from 'react-router-config'\n\nconst routes = [\n  { component: Root,\n    routes: [\n      { path: '/',\n        exact: true,\n        component: Home\n      },\n      { path: '/child/:id',\n        component: Child,\n        routes: [\n          { path: '/child/:id/grand-child',\n            component: GrandChild\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nconst Root = ({ route }) => (\n  <div>\n    <h1>Root</h1>\n    {/* child routes won't render without this */}\n    {renderRoutes(route.routes)}\n  </div>\n)\n\nconst Home = ({ route }) => (\n  <div>\n    <h2>Home</h2>\n  </div>\n)\n\nconst Child = ({ route }) => (\n  <div>\n    <h2>Child</h2>\n    {/* child routes won't render without this */}\n    {renderRoutes(route.routes)}\n  </div>\n)\n\nconst GrandChild = () => (\n  <div>\n    <h3>Grand Child</h3>\n  </div>\n)\n\n\nReactDOM.render((\n  <BrowserRouter>\n    {/* kick it all off with the root route */}\n    {renderRoutes(routes)}\n  </BrowserRouter>\n), document.getElementById('root'))\n\n```\n\n",
